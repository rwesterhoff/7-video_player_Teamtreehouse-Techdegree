                <span>Now that we've looked at the architecture of the internet, let's see how you might</span>
                <span class="active-caption">connect your personal devices to the internet inside your house.</span>
                <span>Well there are many ways to connect to the internet, and</span>
                <span>most often people connect wirelessly.</span>
